# Murali Krishna Kethavath
I can say that I am a responsible and a hard-working student. 
Moreover, being a sociable person, I have many friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting individuals. 
I enjoy my time at the university: it is really nice to study, the students and the professors are very friendly and ready to help.
I like to receive and deal with challenging tasks.
I am a very enthusiastic student and I think this is a strong point of mine.
