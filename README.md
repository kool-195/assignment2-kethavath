#### briyani
Biryani is derived from the **Farsi Persian language** word "brishtah" meaning fried onions, because the dish was made by flavoring rice with fried onions and meat, besides mild spices. Persian was used as an official language in different parts of medieval India by various **Islamic dynasties**.[9][10] One theory states that it originated from birinj , the Persian word for rice.[11][12] Another theory states that it is derived from biryan or beriyan  which means "to fry" or "to roast".
